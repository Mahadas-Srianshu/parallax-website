    <h2>The Daughter</h2>
    <p><br>
      Haggard, disheveled, with cuts all over his body, bleeding he walked towards the edge of the cliff, limping as he did. What was simply a small walk away seemed like an infinitely long path. He walked up to the man sitting at the edge of the cliff.
      <br><br>

The man was huge, muscular, and had long hair. He wore a crown made of gold, studded with diamonds, rubies, and other gems. He was dressed in black.
<br><br>
"You called for me, sir?", he asked.<br><br>

"Your tone has changed a lot, hasn't it?", the man asks still looking away.<br><br>

"Well, you can break the hardest of nuts, sir. I didn't stand a chance"<br><br>

The man in black chuckled.<br><br>

"How are you?"<br><br>

"Not good, sir. Counting seconds, even though it isn't of much use"<br><br>

"Hmmm"<br><br>

There was silence.<br><br>

"Sit down beside me", he moves his mace to the other side.<br><br>

"Thank you, sir", he sits down, feet dangling off the edge.<br><br>

The haggard man smiles. <br><br>

"Thank you, sir", he says. <br><br>

"For?"<br><br>

"The clouds near my feet, sir. They are cool. They heal my wounds" <br><br>

The other man chuckled. <br><br>

"I don't control the weather"<br>
<br>
"You make everything here happen, sir. I know that"<br><br>

A short pause. All they can hear are the subtle sounds of the wind blowing around them. Clouds seemingly merge into oblivion beneath the cliff. The haggard old man cannot decide if it is a sight for a sore eye or a sore sight. 
<br><br>
The man in black opens his palm and a silver glass of water appears.

He offers it to the old man who hurriedly grabs it and gulps it down. 

Once he empties it, it refills and he downs it again. <br><br>

His eyes tear up slightly. <br><br>

"I-", he says, "I was thirsty" <br>
<br>
"I know", he looks down at the small old man, "It has been rough, hasn't it?" <br><br>

"Very much sir" 
<br><br>
"Hmmm" <br><br>

"But-" 
<br><br>
"But?", the man with horns sticking out of his crown asks.<br><br>

"But the pain is bearable, sir. Pain is okay. I can bear it" <br><br>

"Something else hurts you more, doesn't it?" <br><br>

"Yes, sir" <br><br>

"That's insulting to me", the man slightly smirks. <br><br>

However, the old man feels his heart start to beat faster. He immediately adds, <br><br>

"No, sir. I'm sorry. Forgive me. I didn't mean-", he folds his hands apologizing with nothing but pure fear in his eyes. 
<br><br>
"I know, friend. Don't apologize", the man clad in black assures him. He places his hand on his shoulder lightly. 
<br><br>
"Friend?", the man whispers to himself still crouched with his hands folded. 
<br><br>
"Yes, friend. Now sit up" <br>
<br>
He slowly pushed himself up with his frail, veiny arms.<br><br>

"Tell me. What hurts you?" <br><br>

He puts his head down. <br><br>

"I've done many wrong things in my life, sir I've been a terrible son, a horrible friend, a disgusting husband, and a useless father. I could never cherish all that I had. I swindled, gambled, and thieved. Hurt too many people. But what hurts me the most, sir. What hurts me more than, forgive me for saying, more than all the torture you administer is the thought of my daughter." 
<br><br>
"
She's a kind soul. He always was. If she were born elsewhere, she would never had to marry the wrong man because her dumb father forced her. She would never had to run away because he abused her, never had to come back home and hear all my abuses. Even though I hurt her every day, in my last days, she took care of me. She told me she still remembered the time I came home at night and read her stories. She forgave my million sins even though I-. I regret not being able to leave her in comfort. I didn't have the strength to protect her. My sons took everything and left nothing for her. I do not know what happened to her. If she is okay-", his voice trails off.<br><br>

"Look down", the man clears a portion of the clouds by waving his hand. <br><br>

A pause. <br><br>

"Is, is that?", the old man widens his eyes in disbelief. <br><br>

"It is." 
<br><br>
The old man's face becomes more feeble and vulnerable than it already is. <br><br>

"My daughter-" he says putting his arms out, trying to embrace the image of a woman in her mid-forties walking along a sidewalk. She is wearing a cotton saree and is smiling softly as she walks. <br><br>

He cries, uncontrollably, falling onto his knees.<br><br>

"I'm sorry! My kind daughter. I'm sorry."<br><br>

He wails like a child. After a while, the man clad in black speaks,<br><br>

"Your daughter is alright. Someone else is taking care of her. Much better than you ever could"<br>
<br>
These hurtful words consoled the old man to no extent. <br><br>

The image shows a man walking up to her and holding her hand. They walk back together.
<br><br>
"Thank you", he says. 
<br><br>
The man waves his hands and the clouds covered the entire place again. 
<br><br>
They sit there in silence. 
<br><br>
A while later, the man in black stands up to his full gargantuan height. He bends down,
<br><br>
"Time is up" 
<br><br>
The old man stands up smiling. 
<br><br>
"It is not yet over, my friend", he says, " why do you smile?" 
<br><br>
"As I said, sir, the pain in my heart was always worse than the one you administered. Now that that is gone, I can walk through hell with a smile"
